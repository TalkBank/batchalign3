# Morphosyntax Pipeline

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-21 15:30

## 1. Overview

The batchalign morphosyntax pipeline (`morphotag` command) adds %mor and %gra tiers to
CHAT transcripts.  Rust owns CHAT parsing, word extraction, UD-to-CHAT mapping, AST
injection, and serialization.  Python's only role is ML inference — calling Stanza for
POS/lemma/dependency analysis.

### Module Inventory

**Rust** — `batchalign-chat-ops` crate (`crates/batchalign-chat-ops/src/`)

The core NLP mapping logic was extracted from the older PyO3-only layer into
the shared `batchalign-chat-ops` crate during the CHAT ownership boundary
migration. Both the PyO3 bridge (`pyo3/`) and the Rust server
(`crates/batchalign-app`) depend on it. The PyO3 crate now re-exports
`batchalign_chat_ops::nlp::*`.

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `extract.rs` | ~200 | Word extraction from AST |
| `dp_align.rs` | ~790 | Hirschberg alignment |
| `mor_parser.rs` | 66 | %mor/%gra string parsing (delegates to `talkbank_direct_parser::mor_tier`) |
| `inject.rs` | 164 | Morphosyntax injection into AST |
| `retokenize/` | ~1,410 | AST retokenization (5 files: mod, rebuild, mapping, parse_helpers, tests) |
| `nlp/mapping.rs` | ~2,850 | UD-to-CHAT mapping (MOR + GRA generation), `clean_lemma()` |
| `nlp/types.rs` | 227 | UdSentence, UdWord, UdResponse, UniversalPos types |
| `nlp/validation.rs` | 54 | `sanitize_mor_text()` — final guardrail replacing reserved CHAT chars (`\|#-&$~`) with `_` |
| `nlp/lang_en.rs` | 271 | English-specific rules (200+ irregular verbs) |
| `nlp/lang_fr.rs` | 262 | French-specific rules (pronoun case, APM) |
| `nlp/lang_ja.rs` | 460 | Japanese-specific rules (verb form, 140+ rules) |

**Python** (stateless ML inference only)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `inference/morphosyntax.py` | Calls Stanza `nlp()`, returns raw `to_dict()` output |

Python does no orchestration, caching, or UD→CHAT mapping — all handled by Rust.

## 3. What Batchalign Needs from %mor

Batchalign treats %mor tiers as mostly opaque.  No pipeline decomposes POS, lemma, or
features into structured data for analysis.  The consumers and what they actually access:

| Consumer | What it accesses | Decomposes POS/lemma/features? |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cache** (`engine.py`) | Final %mor/%gra strings (BLAKE3 key) | No — stores/retrieves whole strings |
| **Coreference** (`coref`) | Token boundaries in %mor tier | No — counts tokens only |
| **WER evaluation** (`benchmark`) | Token count from %mor for word-level accuracy | No — counts only |
| **Pre-serialization validation** (`validation.py`) | Chunk count alignment (%mor chunks vs %gra relations) | No — calls `count_chunks()` in Rust |
| **CLAN commands** (talkbank-clan crate in talkbank-tools) | Full %mor structure (POS, lemma, suffixes for FREQ/MLU/MLT) | Yes — but via talkbank-model's Mor type |
| **Forced alignment** | No %mor access | N/A |
| **ASR / diarization** | No %mor access | N/A |

**Key finding:** Within batchalign itself, %mor is a cached final string.  The pipeline
generates it (via Stanza + Rust mapping), stores it, and injects it into the AST — but
never reads it back to extract linguistic information.  Downstream consumers that do
decompose %mor (CLAN commands) do so through `talkbank-model`'s typed `Mor` structure, not
through batchalign code.

**Implication for the format:** The flat `POS|lemma[-Feature]*` structure that Stanza
produces is sufficient for batchalign's needs.  Richer UD `key=value` features flow through
the pipeline without code changes — they'd be encoded as CHAT suffixes by `mapping.rs` and
round-tripped by the parser — but no batchalign consumer currently needs them.

## 4. Two MOR Traditions

%mor tiers in CHAT come from two fundamentally different sources, and understanding which
one batchalign produces is key to assessing "information loss."

### CLAN MOR Grammars (Legacy)

Hand-coded per-language grammars, maintained since the 1990s.  They produce rich
morphological structure:

- **Subcategorized POS:** `pro:sub|I`, `n:prop|John`, `v:cop|be`
- **Compounds:** `adj|+adj|big+n|bird` (structured multi-stem words)
- **Prefixes:** `trans#n|port`
- **Morpheme segmentation:** `go&PAST` (fusional) vs `cat-PL` (agglutinative)
- **Language-specific affix inventories** hand-coded per grammar

These grammars are incomplete (not all languages covered), inconsistent across languages,
and require manual maintenance.  They encode a specific morphological theory baked into
each grammar file.

### Stanza UD (What Batchalign Produces)

Automatically trained models producing Universal Dependencies analysis for 70+ languages:

- **Flat UPOS:** `pron|I`, `propn|John`, `aux|be`
- **Lemma + feature list:** `verb|go-Past`, `noun|cat-Plur`
- **MWT clitics:** `pron|I~aux|will`
- **No compounds, no prefixes, no morpheme segmentation**
- **Consistent cross-linguistic feature inventory** (UD standard)
- **Richer dependency structures** (%gra from UD is genuinely better than what CLAN produced)

### What the Model Looks Like

The shared `talkbank-model` `Mor` type:

```rust
struct Mor {
    main: MorWord,
    post_clitics: SmallVec<[MorWord; 2]>,
}

struct MorWord {
    pos: PosCategory,                      // "noun", "verb", "pron", ...
    lemma: MorStem,                        // cleaned stem text
    features: SmallVec<[MorFeature; 4]>,   // flat ordered list
}
```

Three fields per word: POS (string), lemma (string), features (ordered vector of
strings).  This maps cleanly to what Stanza produces — `UPOS` to `pos`, `lemma` to
`lemma`, UD feature values to `features`, MWT components to `post_clitics`.

### What's "Lost"

| Structure | Legacy MOR grammar | Stanza UD | Model representation |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| POS subcategories | `pro:sub\|I` | `pron\|I` | POS string — subcategories preserved if present (parser accepts `pro:sub`) |
| Compounds | `adj\|+adj\|big+n\|bird` | Not produced | Parsed by grammar if encountered; no typed compound field |
| Prefixes | `trans#n\|port` | Not produced | Parsed by grammar if encountered; stored in stem |
| Morpheme segmentation | `go&PAST` vs `go-PAST` | Not produced | Both parsed; suffix carries separator character |
| UD feature keys | N/A | `Number=Plur` | `MorFeature` has optional key field — preserved if present |
| xpos (language-specific POS) | N/A | Available in Stanza | Discarded — only UPOS used |

The structures that the model doesn't have typed fields for — compounds, prefixes,
morpheme boundaries — are structures that **Stanza never produces**.  The model was shaped
to match the producer.

### Freedom from CLAN MOR Constraints

This is mostly a good thing:

- **Cross-linguistic consistency.** CLAN MOR grammars varied wildly per language.  UD gives
  the same feature inventory everywhere.
- **No manual grammar maintenance.** Stanza models are trained automatically.  Adding a
  language means training a model, not writing a grammar by hand.
- **Better dependency analysis.** UD %gra is demonstrably more accurate than what CLAN
  produced — the Rust mapper's O(N) cycle detection catches issues that Python's CLAN-era
  code missed in 87.5% of utterances on test data.
- **Feature transparency.** UD features like `Number=Plur` are semantically meaningful
  and machine-readable.  CLAN suffixes like `-PL` required per-grammar documentation.

### The CLAN Caveat

CLAN commands (`FREQ`, `MLU`, `MLT`) access %mor through `talkbank-model`'s `Mor` type.
For counting (MLU) and frequency (FREQ), the flat `pos + lemma + features` structure is
sufficient.  For fine-grained morphological queries on legacy corpus data — "find all
compound nouns", "count prefixed verbs" — you'd currently have to pattern-match on the POS
string (e.g., `n:prop` contains `:`) or lemma, which works but isn't ideal.

Should the model grow structured compound/prefix/subcategory fields?  Not urgently.
The flat model serves all current use cases, and enriching it would be additive (no
breakage).  Now that batchalign shares `talkbank-model` via path dependencies (no more
vendored copy), any such enrichment is a shared decision visible in talkbank-tools's review
process — the right place for it to happen.

## 5. UD-to-CHAT Mapping

Absorbed from the former `mor-gra-generation.md`.  The mapping lives in
`crates/batchalign-chat-ops/src/nlp/mapping.rs`.

### Pipeline

```
Main tier words
    ↓
Stanza NLP (Python worker, `worker/_infer_hosts.py` → `inference/morphosyntax.py`)
    ↓  produces UdSentence { words: Vec<UdWord> }
    ↓  each UdWord has: id, text, lemma, upos, feats, head, deprel
    ↓
map_ud_sentence() (Rust, mapping.rs)
    ↓  produces (Vec<Mor>, Vec<GrammaticalRelation>)
    ↓
Post-construction validation
    ↓  rejects if chunk count != gra count
    ↓
inject_morphosyntax_from_cache() or add_morphosyntax_batched()
    ↓  writes %mor and %gra tiers into the AST
    ↓
CHAT serialization
```

### MOR Generation

The MOR builder walks the UD sentence and produces one `Mor` item per main-tier word:

- **Single tokens**: `map_ud_word_to_mor()` produces one `Mor` with POS, lemma, feature suffixes
- **MWT Range tokens**: `assemble_mors()` produces one `Mor` with clitics

For MWTs, the mapper identifies which component is the "main" word and which are
clitics (using language-specific `is_clitic()` rules).  Components before the main
become pre-clitics (`$`), components after become post-clitics (`~`):

```
"I'll" → Range(1,2): ["I", "'ll"]
  is_clitic("I", en) → false → main_idx = 0
  Pre-clitics: none
  Post-clitics: ["'ll"]
  Result: pron|I~aux|will
  Chunks: 2 (main + 1 post-clitic)
```

### GRA Generation

**Critical: %gra indices are per-chunk, not per-word.**

Each %mor chunk (including clitics) needs its own %gra relation.  The GRA builder:

1. **Builds a chunk-based index mapping** (`ud_to_chunk_idx`).  Each UD word ID maps
   to a sequential chunk index.  For MWT ranges, each component gets its own index:

   ```
   Range(1,2) "I'll": ID 1 → chunk 1, ID 2 → chunk 2
   Single(3) "give":  ID 3 → chunk 3
   Single(4) "you":   ID 4 → chunk 4
   ```

2. **Emits one GRA relation per component** (not one per MWT).  Each component's
   UD head and deprel are used directly:

   ```
   I:    head=3 (give), deprel=nsubj → 1|3|NSUBJ
   'll:  head=3 (give), deprel=aux   → 2|3|AUX
   give: head=0 (root)               → 3|0|ROOT
   you:  head=3 (give), deprel=iobj  → 4|3|IOBJ
   ```

3. **Adds terminator** PUNCT relation pointing to ROOT.

### TalkBank Conventions

The mapper applies four CHAT-specific transformations, all lossless:

| UD Convention | TalkBank Convention | Example |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| `head=0` for root | `head=0` (same — UD standard since 2026-02-16) | `2\|0\|ROOT` |
| Subtypes with colon | Subtypes with dash | `acl:relcl` → `ACL-RELCL` |
| Lowercase relations | Uppercase relations | `nsubj` → `NSUBJ` |
| Multi-value features with comma | Commas preserved | `PronType=Int,Rel` → `-Int,Rel` |

The first three are trivially reversible surface-syntax changes.  The comma convention
preserves the UD multi-value separator as-is.  This differs from older CLAN-produced
corpus data which used concatenation (`IntRel`, `AccNom`).  The tree-sitter grammar and
%mor parser both accept commas in suffix values.

### POS Mapping

POS categories use lowercased UPOS tags:

| UPOS | CHAT POS | Suffix features |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| NOUN | `noun\|` | Gender, Number, Case, Ger |
| VERB/AUX | `verb\|`/`aux\|` | VerbForm, Tense, Person, -irr |
| PRON | `pron\|` | PronType, Case, Reflex, Number, Person |
| DET | `det\|` | Gender, Definite, PronType |
| ADJ | `adj\|` | Degree, Case |
| ADP | `adp\|` | (none) |
| PROPN | `propn\|` | (none) |
| INTJ | `intj\|` | (none) |
| CCONJ | `cconj\|` | (none) |
| SCONJ | `sconj\|` | (none) |

Language-specific rules exist for English (200+ irregular verbs in `lang_en.rs`), French
(pronoun case, APM in `lang_fr.rs`), and Japanese (verb form overrides, 140+ rules in
`lang_ja.rs`).

## 6. Post-Construction Validation

`map_ud_sentence` validates generated output before returning:

### Structural GRA Validation

`validate_generated_gra` enforces four rules:

- **Single root** — exactly one self-referential or head=0 relation (excluding terminator)
- **No circular dependencies** — no word is its own ancestor in the head chain
- **Valid heads** — all head references point to existing word indices or 0
- **Sequential indices** — guaranteed by construction

Cycle detection uses an **O(N) White-Gray-Black DFS with memoization**: each word follows
its head chain to the root, marking nodes IN_PROGRESS (gray) on the way down and NO_CYCLE
(black) on the way back.  Encountering a gray node means a cycle.

On failure, `validate_generated_gra` returns `Err(MappingError)` with a detailed error
message including the full invalid structure.  The caller (morphosyntax orchestrator) logs the error and
skips the utterance — no corrupted %gra is written to disk.

The Rust mapper uses `HashMap<usize, usize>` to translate UD word IDs to CHAT chunk
indices.  Missing keys fall through to `unwrap_or(&0)` (caught by the valid-heads check),
rather than silently wrapping around like Python master's `actual_indicies[elem[1]-1]`
array indexing — which was the root cause of Python's circular dependency bug.

### Chunk Count Alignment

The critical guard added after the MWT/GRA bug:

```rust
let mor_chunk_count = mors.iter().map(|m| m.count_chunks()).sum::<usize>() + 1;
if gras.len() != mor_chunk_count {
    return Err(MappingError::ChunkCountMismatch { ... });
}
```

This catches any mismatch at generation time, preventing corrupted data from ever being
written to CHAT files.

## 7. Module Details

### `lib.rs` — PyO3 Entry Points

Key morphosyntax functions exported to Python via `#[pymodule]`:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `extract_morphosyntax_payloads(handle)` | Extract all utterance payloads as JSON array |
| `inject_morphosyntax_from_cache(handle, ...)` | Inject cached %mor/%gra strings into AST |
| `add_morphosyntax_batched(handle, lang, callback, ...)` | Batched pipeline: extract → callback → inject |
| `extract_morphosyntax_strings(handle)` | Extract final %mor/%gra strings for cache storage |
| `extract_nlp_words(chat_text, domain)` | Extract alignable words as JSON |
| `py_dp_align(payload, reference, case_insensitive)` | Hirschberg alignment |

### `extract.rs` — Word Extraction

Walks the CHAT AST using `walk_words()` (from `talkbank-model`) and collects words appropriate for a given tier domain. The walker centralizes traversal of all 24 `UtteranceContent` variants and 22 `BracketedItem` variants; `extract.rs` provides only the word-handling closures for `counts_for_tier()` filtering and `ReplacedWord` branch logic.

```rust
pub struct ExtractedWord {
    pub text: String,              // cleaned text (for NLP)
    pub raw_text: String,          // original text (with markers)
    pub special_form: Option<String>,  // @c → "c", @s → "s", etc.
}
```

**Domain-aware traversal** via `TierDomain`:

| Domain | Retraces | Replacements | Untranscribed (xxx) |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Mor | Skipped | Use replacement words | Skipped |
| Wor | Included | Use original words | Included |

### `dp_align.rs` — Hirschberg Alignment

Rust-only Hirschberg implementation (Python `utils/dp.py` no longer exists):
- **Cost model:** match=0, substitution=2, gap=1
- **Space:** O(min(n,m)) via Hirschberg's linear-space trick
- **Small cutoff:** Falls back to full DP table when n*m < 2048

### `mor_parser.rs` — %mor/%gra Parsing

Delegates to `talkbank_direct_parser::mor_tier` for parsing %mor strings into typed
`Mor` and `GrammaticalRelation` structures.  `embed_gra_on_mors()` attaches GRA relations
to Mor items by 1-indexed chunk position.

### `inject.rs` — Morphosyntax Injection

1. Walks the AST using the same traversal order as `extract.rs`
2. Assigns Mor items to alignable Word nodes
3. Builds tier markers (`MorTierMarker`, `GraTierMarker`)
4. Adds to utterance dependent tiers, replacing existing tiers if present

**Key invariant:** traversal order in `inject.rs` must exactly match `extract.rs`.

### `retokenize/` — AST Retokenization

Split into five files: `mod.rs` (entry point), `rebuild.rs` (AST rebuilding),
`mapping.rs` (word index mapping), `parse_helpers.rs` (word parsing), `tests.rs`.

When `retokenize=true`, Stanza uses its own UD tokenizer, which can change word
boundaries (splits, merges, different text).  The algorithm:

1. Character-level DP alignment between original and Stanza token texts
2. Build mapping: original_word_idx → stanza_token_indices
3. Walk AST, rebuilding content vectors (1:1, 1:N splits, preserving non-word content)
4. New Words created via `DirectParser::parse_word()` (not `Word::new()`)
5. Inject tiers via `inject::inject_morphosyntax()`

### `nlp/mapping.rs` — UD-to-CHAT Mapping

The core mapping logic: `map_ud_sentence()` converts a `UdSentence` (from Stanza) into
`(Vec<Mor>, Vec<GrammaticalRelation>)`.  See [Section 5](#5-ud-to-chat-mapping) for details.

## 8. The Callback Pattern

### Batched Payload (Rust → Python)

The primary path is batched: Rust collects all utterance payloads in one pass and sends
them as a JSON array.  Each element:

```json
{
  "words": ["I", "eat", "cookies"],
  "terminator": ".",
  "special_forms": [null, null, null]
}
```

With special forms (e.g., `gumma@c`):
```json
{
  "words": ["gumma", "is", "yummy"],
  "terminator": ".",
  "special_forms": [["gumma", "c"], null, null]
}
```

### Response (Python → Rust)

```json
{
  "mor": "pro:sub|I v|eat n|cookie-PL .",
  "gra": "1|2|SUBJ 2|0|ROOT 3|2|OBJ 4|2|PUNCT",
  "tokens": ["I", "eat", "cookies"]
}
```

The `tokens` field is always present.  When `retokenize=false`, it's ignored.  When
`retokenize=true`, Rust compares tokens against original words and rebuilds the AST if
they differ.

### Worker-side batch inference (`worker/_infer_hosts.py` + `inference/morphosyntax.py`)

The worker-side morphosyntax host wraps Stanza to conform to this interface:

1. Parse JSON payload array
2. For each utterance: replace special-form words with `"xbxxx"` (Stanza placeholder)
3. Strip parentheses, join words as text
4. Set `tokenizer_context["sentence"]` for Stanza's postprocessor
5. Call `nlp(text)` under lock on GIL-enabled Python
6. `map_ud_sentence()` converts UD output to %mor/%gra
7. Extract Stanza token texts
8. Return `[{mor, gra, tokens}, ...]` JSON array

### Cache Orchestration

Caching is handled at the server orchestration level (`process_morphosyntax_batch()`), not in the
inference module.  The flow:

1. `extract_morphosyntax_payloads()` — get all utterance payloads
2. For each payload, compute BLAKE3 key from `text + lang + "|mwt"`
3. Cache hits: `inject_morphosyntax_from_cache()` — inject cached strings
4. Cache misses: send to batch callback, inject results, store in cache
5. `extract_morphosyntax_strings()` — extract final strings for cache storage

## 9. Gotchas

### `cleaned_text` is Derived, Not Settable

The CHAT serializer uses `Word.content` (WordContents), not `raw_text` or `cleaned_text`.
Simply changing `word.cleaned_text = "new"` does not change serialized output.  To create
a word with different text, use `DirectParser::parse_word()`.

### `Word::new()` Bypasses Validation

`Word::new(raw_text, cleaned_text)` creates a minimal Word with a single `WordContent::Text`
element.  For retokenization where text comes from Stanza (may contain CHAT-significant
characters), prefer `parse_token_as_word()` which runs the full parser.

### Traversal Order Must Match Between extract/inject/retokenize

All three modules walk the AST using `walk_words()` / `walk_words_mut()` from
`talkbank-model`, ensuring identical traversal order. The walker handles group recursion
and domain-aware gating centrally. If leaf-handling closures apply different filtering
between extraction and injection, morphology is assigned to wrong words.

### Separator Word Counter Sync

`extract.rs` includes tag-marker separators (comma `,`, tag `„`, vocative `‡`) as NLP
words in the Mor domain.  Any code walking the AST with a `word_counter` must also
increment for separators.  `retokenize.rs` handles this explicitly.  Forgetting causes
counter desync.

### Manual JSON Parsing

`batchalign-core` uses manual JSON field extraction instead of serde_json at runtime to
avoid the dependency in the release binary.  The parsers handle escapes but are not
general-purpose.

### Special Forms and `xbxxx`

Words with `@c`, `@s`, `@b` markers are replaced with `"xbxxx"` before Stanza analysis.
When `retokenize=true`, `retokenize.rs` restores original text via `resolve_token_text()`.

### `skipmultilang` and Language Handling

When `skipmultilang=true`, utterances with `[- lang]` override where the language differs
from the file's primary language are skipped.  Language codes: file language is ISO 639-3
(`"eng"`, `"fra"`); callback adapter converts to ISO 639-1 (`"en"`, `"fr"`) for Stanza.

### `BracketedItems` is a Newtype

`BracketedContent.content` is `BracketedItems(Vec<BracketedItem>)`, a newtype that does
not implement `Default`.  Use `std::mem::replace(&mut field, BracketedItems(Vec::new()))`
instead of `std::mem::take()`.

### Stanza `token.id` is Always a Tuple

`(word_id,)` for regular words, `(start, end)` for MWT.  Never assume it's an int.
