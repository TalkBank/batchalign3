# Server Mode

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-27 11:18 EDT

Batchalign includes a built-in HTTP server managed by `batchalign3 serve ...`.
Ordinary local processing commands no longer require that server. The CLI now
defaults to **direct local execution** and only enters server mode when the user
explicitly chooses `--server` or starts a server for remote/dashboard workflows.

## Current routing rules

- With `--server URL`, the CLI submits supported jobs to that server.
- Without `--server`, the CLI runs the command locally through the shared
  direct host.
- Audio-dependent commands such as `align`, `transcribe`, `transcribe_s`,
  `benchmark`, `opensmile`, and `avqi` now submit shared-filesystem `paths_mode`
  jobs when `--server` is set. The server must be able to read the same input
  paths and write the requested output paths.
- `batchalign3 serve ...` remains useful for remote access, dashboard-backed
  job monitoring, persistent warm workers, and explicit server-managed queues.

## Start a server

Foreground:

```bash
batchalign3 serve start --foreground
```

Background:

```bash
batchalign3 serve start
```

Useful flags:

```bash
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --port 8000
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --config ~/server.yaml
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --warmup minimal
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --test-echo
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --backend temporal --test-echo --warmup off
```

## Backend selection

`batchalign3 serve start` now accepts `--backend embedded|temporal`.

- `embedded` remains the default and is still the recommended local/single-host
  backend.
- `temporal` is an experimental clean-slate control-plane backend. It keeps the
  shared Batchalign execution engine and worker pool, but hands queued-job
  orchestration, retry timing, and durable cancellation/restart state to
  Temporal workflows and activities.

This backend choice only affects explicit server mode. Ordinary local CLI use
still defaults to the direct host and does not require any Temporal service.

To try the Temporal backend locally, start a Temporal dev server first:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
batchalign3 serve start --foreground --backend temporal --test-echo --warmup off
```

## Check and stop a server

```bash
batchalign3 serve status
batchalign3 serve status --server http://myserver:8000
batchalign3 serve stop
```

Inspect remote jobs:

```bash
batchalign3 jobs --server http://myserver:8000
batchalign3 jobs --server http://myserver:8000 <JOB_ID>
```

When that server is running with `--backend temporal`,
`batchalign3 jobs --server ... <JOB_ID>` also reports the Temporal workflow ID,
run ID, workflow status, task queue, and history length for that Batchalign
job.

Important `--test-echo` caveat:

- `--test-echo` is a control-plane smoke path, not a full model simulation.
- Text-only infer-task commands such as `morphotag`, `utseg`, `translate`,
  `coref`, and `compare` are expected to fail under `--test-echo` because the
  echo worker does not advertise real `infer_tasks`.
- Use it to validate startup, submission, restart, cancellation, deletion, and
  remote job inspection. Do not treat it as proof that infer-task commands are
  semantically correct.

## Server configuration

Default config path:

```text
~/.batchalign3/server.yaml
```

Minimal example:

```yaml
default_lang: eng
port: 8000
max_concurrent_jobs: 8
auto_daemon: true
warmup_commands: [morphotag, align, transcribe]
media_roots: []
media_mappings: {}
```

Temporal-specific config keys:

```yaml
backend: temporal
temporal_server_url: http://127.0.0.1:7233
temporal_namespace: default
temporal_task_queue: batchalign3-server
temporal_heartbeat_s: 5
temporal_activity_timeout_s: 3600
```

`warmup_commands` now marks commands that are *eligible* for warmup. The
current production startup path remains lazy by default, so this key is no
longer a promise that those workers will preload on every boot.

When warmup does spawn TCP daemons, they are now treated as **server-owned**
workers: reusable for that server instance, but cleaned up on routine shutdown.
If you want a daemon to survive server restarts, start it externally and let the
server discover it from `workers.json`. Direct local execution does not perform
that registry discovery step.

## Cold-start capability checks

On a cold server, especially with `--warmup off`, the startup path may only know
an **optimistic** command list before any real worker has been spawned. That is
intentional: startup no longer pays for a dedicated probe worker just to fill in
capability metadata.

What matters operationally is that execution now does a live check before it
trusts infer-task gating. The first real `morphotag`, `align`, `compare`, or
similar job boots the needed worker, probes its actual infer-task support, and
then runs. If the backend is truly unavailable, the job now fails with the
worker/bootstrap error instead of with a stale placeholder `infer_tasks: []`
message.

If startup finds healthy registry daemons that are already running, the server
now seeds capability state from those live workers immediately. That means a
server can come up with a real `/health.capabilities` surface without spawning a
fresh probe worker, as long as discoverable daemons already exist.

## Registry daemon ownership

`~/.batchalign3/workers.json` can now contain two daemon kinds:

- **external** daemons, started outside the current server lifecycle
- **server-owned** daemons, started by the current Rust server instance

Routine shutdown only kills the current server's own server-owned daemons.
External daemons are preserved and rediscovered on the next startup.

At startup, registry discovery reuses healthy external daemons, preserves live
foreign server-owned daemons by skipping them, and reaps stale foreign
server-owned daemons whose owning server is gone.

Important keys:

- `port` — server listen port
- `host` — bind address (defaults to `0.0.0.0`)
- `backend` — server control-plane backend: `embedded` (default) or experimental `temporal`
- `max_concurrent_jobs` — `0` means auto-tune
- `auto_daemon` — legacy compatibility field; the CLI now defaults to direct local execution instead of auto-starting a daemon
- `warmup_commands` — list of commands eligible for warmup (see [Worker Tuning](worker-tuning.md))
- `media_roots` — local execution-host media lookup roots
- `media_mappings` — local execution-host root mappings from corpus paths to
  mounted media paths; useful when the CHAT/data clone root differs from the
  media root on the same machine
- `temporal_server_url` / `temporal_namespace` / `temporal_task_queue` — Temporal connection settings used only when `backend: temporal`
- `temporal_heartbeat_s` / `temporal_activity_timeout_s` — Temporal activity heartbeat and per-attempt timeout controls
- `memory_tier` — override auto-detected tier: `small`, `medium`, `large`, `fleet` (also controls task-vs-profile bootstrap mode)
- `memory_gate_mb` — host headroom reserve (default: tier-dependent, 2000-8000 MB)
- `gpu_startup_mb` / `stanza_startup_mb` / `io_startup_mb` — per-profile startup reservation overrides (0 = tier default)
- `worker_idle_timeout_s` — shut down idle workers after this many seconds (default: tier-dependent — 60s Small, 300s Medium, 600s Large/Fleet)
- `worker_health_interval_s` — health check frequency in seconds (default: 30)
- `job_ttl_days` — auto-delete completed jobs after this many days (default: 7)

OTLP tracing can be enabled by setting `BATCHALIGN_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
(or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) in the server environment.

Reference example files live in `examples/server.yaml` and
`examples/launchd.plist`.

`server.yaml` uses a strict schema. Unknown keys are rejected at startup
instead of being silently ignored, so stale config like `warmup: false` must
be updated to the current `warmup_commands: []` form.

## Remote use

Commands that support explicit remote dispatch look like this:

```bash
batchalign3 --server http://myserver:8000 morphotag corpus/ -o output/
batchalign3 --server http://myserver:8000 align corpus/ -o output/
```

For audio commands, `--server` now means "run this on a host that can already
see these filesystem paths." The clean operational model is to run the CLI on
the execution host itself (or to reach it over SSH/VNC) rather than expecting
the server to infer media from a different client machine's directory layout.
When the corpus clone root and the mounted media root differ on that execution
host, use local `media_mappings` or `--media-dir` as explicit root replacement.

Health checks:

```bash
curl -s http://myserver:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool
batchalign3 serve status --server http://myserver:8000
```

The `/health` response includes a `capabilities` list. On a warm server, or on a
startup that already discovered live registry daemons, treat that list as the
detected command surface. On a cold lazy server with no discovered workers, it
may still be the optimistic startup surface until the first live worker probe
completes.

If a command is missing from `/health` **after** the server has warmed or run a
real job for that family, the server's Python environment is likely missing a
required package. See
[Troubleshooting: "Command not supported"](troubleshooting.md#command-not-supported-or-missing-commands).

## launchd example (macOS)

For always-on macOS hosts, use `examples/launchd.plist` as a template and
update the binary path, username, and log paths before installing it as a
LaunchDaemon.
