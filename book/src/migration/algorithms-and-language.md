# Algorithms, Language, and Alignment Migration

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-28 17:54 EDT

Comparison anchors:

- `batchalign2` baseline `84ad500b09e52a82aca982c41a8ccd46b01f4f2c` (2026-01-09)
- later released `batchalign2` master-branch point
  `e8f8bfada6170aa0558a638e5b73bf2c3675fe6d` (2026-02-09) where relevant
- current `batchalign3`

This page documents durable algorithmic and data-structure changes only.
Temporary migration-branch experiments do not belong here.

For user-facing command and output consequences, start with
[User Workflow Migration](user-migration.md). This page explains the mechanism
behind those differences.

## Comparison discipline

Algorithmic/output parity claims in this page are anchored to the correct Jan 9
baseline for the material under test:

- core / non-HK claims: Jan 9 `batchalign2-master`
- HK / Cantonese claims: Jan 9 `BatchalignHK`

- Later Feb 9 BA2 behavior can still be useful secondary evidence when the
  question is specifically about the last released BA2 master branch.
- later Python operational builds are not the migration baseline for the
  algorithmic claims documented here.

Use the repo comparison harnesses with the historically correct
`84ad500...`-pinned runner when validating these deltas in practice. For HK
material, that means `batchalignhk`, not stock `batchalign`.

## 1) CHAT parser/validator/AST/serialization as the central algorithmic change

The most important migration is architectural and algorithmic: parsing and
validating CHAT is now a typed, structured pipeline. This reduces failure modes
caused by line-oriented text surgery and makes downstream alignment and `%mor`/`%gra`
operations operate on stable structure.

Implication for contributors: if a change can be expressed as AST transform, do
that first; avoid direct string hacking.

## 1.1) Why this changed correctness, not just implementation language

The main gain is not "Rust is faster." The gain is that parsing, validation,
injection, and serialization now operate on stable typed structure.

That directly changes user-visible correctness:

- fewer opportunities for `%mor`/`%gra` drift from line-oriented text surgery,
- fewer silent remap choices after tokenization/alignment divergence,
- stronger validation before invalid CHAT is written back out.

This is a fundamental redesign, not incremental cleanup: ad-hoc string
manipulation and parallel-array patching are replaced by principled typed
structure with explicit provenance — and that structural shift is what drives
both the correctness and efficiency gains throughout the migration.

That pattern shows up repeatedly across the migration:

- UTR uses global Hirschberg DP alignment (the same proven approach as old
  batchalign, now in Rust),
- FA now carries explicit word identity and timing-mode metadata,
- retokenization uses deterministic range/index mapping and AST rebuilds,
- `%gra` generation uses explicit chunk/head validation rather than positional
  guesswork.
- `utseg` now treats constituency parsing and assignment computation as separate
  steps instead of flattening subtree leaves and DP-aligning them back to forms.
- `coref` now carries typed sentence/chain structure instead of detokenized text
  plus DP remap back to utterance positions.

For migration purposes, separate:

| Stage | Algorithm/data-structure shift |
|---|---|
| Jan 9 BA2 -> Feb 9 BA2 | released BA2 already improved DP behavior, caching boundaries, and a number of robustness/performance details inside the Python architecture |
| Feb 9 BA2 -> current BA3 | current code goes further by moving key remap/injection/validation logic into Rust-owned chat-ops and typed orchestration |

## 2) Dynamic programming: what was removed, what remains

### Narrowed or removed from runtime remap paths

- Retokenize char-level DP fallback mapping path was removed, replaced by
  deterministic interval/index mapping with length-aware monotonic fallback.
- FA response handling uses indexed word timings or deterministic token
  stitching in `fa/alignment.rs` — no DP.

For FA, the precise current claim is narrower:

- current Rust FA response handling uses indexed word timings or
  deterministic token stitching in `fa/alignment.rs`;
- it does not use the Jan 9 / Feb 9 BA2 broad transcript-wide remap policy;
- a shared Hirschberg DP library still exists in-tree, so the accurate migration
  claim is that runtime remap policy was narrowed, not that every DP use
  disappeared.

### UTR: global DP is the steady-state correctness boundary

UTR timing recovery (`fa/utr.rs`) uses a single global Hirschberg DP alignment
of all document words against all ASR tokens.

This is the correct steady-state algorithm for the 407-style hand-edited
transcript case: transcript words and ASR tokens are two independent
full-document sequences, so the matcher must reason globally rather than
utterance by utterance. The Rust Hirschberg implementation is O(mn) time,
O(min(m,n)) space, and runs 10-50x faster than the old Python implementation.

This fixes token-starvation failures where local matching consumed tokens too
early. It does not solve every alignment pathology: dense `&*` overlap and
larger text/audio order divergence still remain a limitation of any monotonic
aligner.

### Intentionally retained

- model-internal alignment/decoding internals (e.g., CTC/Whisper internals)
- evaluation/edit-distance style metrics (WER and similar analysis tooling)

Policy: runtime user-output remap should not silently reintroduce global DP tie
ambiguity in paths where deterministic mapping is available.

This is a durable migration boundary. DP is legitimate when aligning two
genuinely independent sequences (UTR: transcript words vs ASR tokens; WER:
hypothesis vs reference). It is a regression when runtime output reconstruction
uses global DP to paper over mismatches that should be handled by deterministic
identity/index mapping (retokenization, FA injection, `%mor`/`%gra` attachment).

## 3) Realign-after-edit consequences

When transcript edits occur after initial alignment:

- deterministic ID/index matching preserves timing slots where provenance remains,
- bounded window policies prevent cross-utterance remap jumps,
- unresolved ambiguity yields explicit unassigned outcomes (not hidden remap).

This is the intended operational tradeoff: transparent uncertainty over unstable
auto-corrections.

For migrators, this means some BA2-to-BA3 output differences are expected:

- Jan 9 / Feb 9 BA2 output may have looked "more complete" because ambiguous words were forced
  into a global remap anyway;
- current BA3 output may leave some timing/provenance unresolved explicitly;
- that is a correctness choice, not a missing feature.

### 3.1) `align` improvements

Feb 9 BA2 already improved cache use, DP edge cases, and FA failure handling.
BA3 goes further by moving FA grouping, timing injection, `%wor`,
monotonicity, and overlap cleanup into Rust orchestration with typed FA
payloads and deterministic transfer rules.

One especially important `align` sub-change is UTR:

- released BA2 recovered utterance timing via a single global Hirschberg DP
  alignment of all transcript words against all ASR tokens;
- BA3 now uses the same global Hirschberg approach (in Rust), preserving the
  correct full-document alignment model while moving the implementation onto
  the typed Rust chat-ops boundary.
- This fixes the 407-style token-starvation regression class, but it does not
  make UTR non-monotonic. Files with dense overlap and text/audio reordering
  can still remain only partially recoverable.

#### Fuzzy UTR matching (new in BA3)

BA2 used exact string matching between transcript words and ASR tokens.
BA3 adds fuzzy matching via Jaro-Winkler similarity (threshold 0.85,
configurable via `--utr-fuzzy`). This improves UTR coverage on files
with ASR substitutions, dialectal variants, and backchannel
normalizations (e.g., transcript "mhm" matching ASR "mm-hmm").

Validated on 6 corpora (59 files):
- SBCSAE: 76.8% coverage (vs lower with exact), 140ms median precision
- APROCSA, TaiwanHakka, Welsh, German: identical to exact matching
- No regressions on any corpus

Fuzzy matching is now the default. Exact matching remains available
via `--utr-fuzzy 1.0`.

#### Two-pass overlap-aware UTR (new in BA3)

BA2 had no overlap awareness in UTR — overlap markers (`+<`, `&*`)
were treated the same as regular words. BA3 implements a two-pass
strategy for conversation-analysis data:

1. **Pass 1 (global):** Align all non-overlap words against ASR tokens
   to establish the timing backbone. Overlap markers are excluded so
   they don't consume ASR tokens that belong to the primary speaker.

2. **Pass 2 (targeted):** For each unresolved overlap utterance, search
   for its ASR timing using index-aware onset matching — multiple `⌊`
   respondents match the correct `⌈` by overlap index with
   speaker-aware fallback.

When auto-selected (default), two-pass activates only when overlap
markers are detected. Falls back to single-pass global for files
without overlap.

#### Density-aware overlap exclusion (new in BA3)

When >30% of utterances have overlap markers (dense CA data like
Jefferson NB at 47% overlap), excluding all overlap words from pass-1
starves the aligner of context. BA3 detects this and stops excluding
overlap words, falling back to global alignment.

Threshold: `MAX_OVERLAP_EXCLUSION_FRACTION = 0.30` (empirically chosen).
Jefferson NB: pass-1 exclusion recovered 8.8% at 1491ms error; with
density detection, recovered 10.7% at 691ms error.

#### Language-aware UTR strategy selection (new in BA3)

Non-English files use GlobalUtr (avoiding the two-pass regression from
noisier non-English ASR), English files use the overlap-inspecting
auto-selection. Validated experimentally on 7 non-English files across
4 languages — preserves English gains (+4.3pp SBCSAE, +3.8pp Jefferson)
while eliminating non-English regressions.

#### CA pre-validation (new in BA3)

Files with `@Options: CA` now skip the utterance terminator check during
validation. CA transcripts commonly use non-standard terminators. This
unblocked alignment of Jefferson NB and TaiwanHakka corpora that BA2
would reject or produce validation errors on.

#### `--media-dir` flag (new in BA3)

`batchalign3 align input/ -o output/ --media-dir /path/to/audio/` allows
specifying a separate directory for audio files. BA2 required audio files
to be alongside the `.cha` files. This supports workflows where media
is stored separately from transcripts (common in corpus archives).

#### Align improvement summary

| Feature | BA2 Jan 9 | BA3 |
|---|---|---|
| UTR matching | Exact only | Fuzzy (Jaro-Winkler 0.85) default |
| Overlap awareness | None | Two-pass with index-aware onset matching |
| Dense overlap handling | None (all words treated equally) | Density detection (>30% → global fallback) |
| Language-aware UTR | None (same strategy for all langs) | Auto-gates by language (non-English → GlobalUtr) |
| CA validation | Strict (rejects CA terminators) | `@Options: CA` pre-validation skip |
| Custom media directory | Not supported | `--media-dir` flag |
| FA orchestration | Python string surgery | Rust typed payloads + deterministic transfer |

## 4) Retokenization and Stanza multi-token outputs

Batchalign3 accounts for multi-word token expansion and tokenization divergence
with deterministic interval/index mapping logic, preserving monotonic ordering.

Practical outcomes:

- one source token yielding multiple UD tokens is handled through explicit mapping,
- merged/split forms are attached by deterministic policy rather than global
  string-level DP reconciliation,
- divergence remains visible and testable in golden fixtures.

This directly addresses the "multiple tokens from Stanza" migration concern:
token expansion is treated as structured provenance mapping, not as text that
must later be globally realigned by DP.

## 4.1) Morphotag and `%gra` correctness consequences

Durable migration-relevant correctness changes include:

- `%gra` root attachment now follows standard root-head semantics instead of
  self-referential root indices;
- reflexive pronoun suffix handling was corrected;
- MWT chunk mapping avoids brittle positional assumptions;
- tokenizer-generated divergence is either deterministically mapped back or left
  explicit, rather than silently "fixed" by a global text remap.

Concrete currently tested consequences include:

- ROOT must attach to virtual root `0`, not to itself;
- invalid root/head/chunk-count combinations are rejected;
- MWT expansions produce per-component `%gra` relations;
- `@c` and `@s` special forms are mapped explicitly rather than relying on
  placeholder leakage;
- `xbxxx` placeholders are restored back to the original form in retokenized
  output;
- reflexive pronouns explicitly emit `reflx`;
- retokenization can split contractions structurally, while `retokenize=false`
  preserves original tokenization.

Important comparison nuance:

- reflexive `reflx`, special-form handling, and `xbxxx` restoration were not
  invented only in current BA3; older BA2 already had versions of those
  behaviors in Python `ud.py`;
- the more durable current shift is that ROOT/head/chunk semantics and
  retokenization behavior are now enforced through explicit mapping logic and
  tests rather than left to positional array repair.

For corpus maintainers, this means BA3 `%mor`/`%gra` diffs against BA2 should be
reviewed as likely corrections first.

## 4.2) From positional repair to principled indexing

The durable algorithmic shift is away from workflows like:

- flatten text,
- keep parallel arrays,
- patch indices after skips/merges,
- run broad DP when the arrays drift.

Toward workflows like:

- carry stable word identity,
- maintain explicit utterance/word/chunk indices,
- iterate AST content directly,
- use deterministic local fallback only where provenance is missing.

Concrete command-level examples:

- `transcribe`:
  - BA2 Python built transcript structure while it was still normalizing token
    strings and punctuation;
  - BA3 separates tagged raw ASR payloads from Rust normalization, Rust
    postprocess, and Rust CHAT assembly.
- `translate`:
  - BA2 translated utterance strings and then relied on Python generation to
    materialize output tiers;
  - BA3 extracts utterance payloads from the AST and injects `%xtra` back by
    line index.
- `utseg`:
  - BA2 flattened constituency subtrees to strings, aligned them back to form
    arrays, then rebuilt utterances;
  - BA3 returns raw tree strings, computes assignment vectors, then splits AST
    utterances by index.
- `coref`:
  - BA2 flattened the document to one detokenized string and DP-mapped chain
    payloads back to `(utterance, form)` slots;
  - BA3 uses sentence arrays and typed chain refs, then injects sparse
    `%xcoref` by validated sentence/line mapping.

This matters because it reduces accidental correctness:

- fewer outputs that "look plausible" only because a later repair pass guessed
  the intended alignment,
- more outputs whose correctness follows from preserved structure and validated
  index relationships.

## 4.3) Cantonese / HK ASR tokenization

HK / Cantonese parity has one additional algorithmic wrinkle that deserves to
be called out explicitly.

- Cantonese material must be compared against the Jan 9 `BatchalignHK` baseline.
- The relevant preserved legacy command is `batchalignhk`.
- For `yue`, semantically correct ASR text can still benchmark badly if the
  runtime keeps long Han-script chunks as one giant token instead of splitting
  them into character tokens before retokenization and scoring.

Current `batchalign3` now handles this in the Rust-owned ASR post-process path:

- Cantonese text is normalized to HK traditional form,
- Han-script `yue` ASR chunks are split with the shared
  `cantonese_char_tokens()` helper,
- ASCII/code-switched tokens are left intact,
- punctuation-based utterance retokenization then runs on those normalized
  tokens.

This matters because WER/compare behavior for Cantonese is sensitive to token
granularity. A transcript can be visibly "close" while still scoring as a large
regression if the main path presents only a few giant tokens to the scorer.

## 5) Japanese and multilingual preprocessing/postprocessing

### Japanese verb-form and POS overrides

`nlp/lang_ja.rs` (460 lines, ported from Python `ja/verbforms.py`) applies 50+
ordered override rules that run before UD→CHAT POS mapping. These correct Stanza
outputs for colloquial Japanese forms that the model frequently misclassifies:

- **Subordinating conjunctions:** contracted conditionals (ちゃ→ば, なきゃ,
  じゃ→ちゃ, たら, たっ, で) reclassified from VERB/AUX to SCONJ.
- **Auxiliary verbs:** colloquial endings (れる→られる, よう→おう, だら→たら,
  だ→た, 無い→ない, せる→させる, なさい→為さい) with corrected lemmas.
- **Interjections:** backchannels and fillers (はい, うん, おっ, ほら, ヤッホー,
  ただいま) reclassified from NOUN/VERB to INTJ.
- **Verb lemma corrections:** specific kanji verbs (撮る, 貼る, 混ぜる, 釣る,
  降りる/降る, 載せる, 帰る, 舐める, etc.) that Stanza assigns wrong lemmas.
- **Noun/pronoun fixes:** colloquial forms (あたし→PRON, バツ, ブラシ,
  引き出し, クシャミ) and onomatopoeia (ゴロンっ, モチーンっ).

### Japanese Stanza processor configuration

Japanese requires the `combined` Stanza processor package (tokenize+pos+lemma+depparse
in one model), not separate processors. This is enforced in
`test_stanza_config_parity.py` to prevent misconfiguration that causes silent
accuracy degradation.

### Multilingual safeguards

- Multilingual routing and normalization safeguards for code-switch contexts.
- Stronger consistency between preprocessing and serializer outputs.

## 5.1) Performance consequences of the algorithm shift

The performance wins that belong in migration documentation are the durable ones:

- deterministic mapping avoids some expensive reconstruction work that used to
  happen after engine calls;
- better cache boundaries mean repeated morphosyntax/alignment work is skipped
  more often;
- batching and warm workers reduce per-file startup overhead.

Point-in-time benchmark spikes do not belong here unless they became a durable
property of the released architecture.

## 6) Overlap and rapid interleaving speech

A known limit remains: rapidly overlapping/interleaving speaker turns are still
hard for perfect automatic assignment. The migration improves this by local
window constraints and deterministic fallback, but does not claim complete
disambiguation in all overlap-heavy audio.

Mitigation strategy:

- preserve all candidate structure and timings,
- avoid global crossing remaps,
- expose unresolved slots for explicit review tools.

## 7) Regression governance

Algorithmic migrations are now defended by:

- golden test matrices (`batchalign/tests/golden/`),
- no-DP-runtime allowlist tests
  (`batchalign/tests/test_dp_allowlist.py` — 3 tests: Rust PyO3 call sites,
  chat-ops call sites, Python inference zero-DP),
- tracing instrumentation for mapping-mode divergence
  (`retokenize/mapping.rs` line 61: `warn!` when falling back to
  length-aware monotonic mapping).

That governance change is itself part of the migration: the codebase is less
willing to accept "looks plausible on a few files" as evidence that an
algorithmic rewrite is safe.

## Language handling: no silent fallbacks, early validation

### Policy: hard-error on unknown languages, never silent fallback

batchalign3 deliberately rejects unknown or unsupported language codes
**at the earliest possible point** with a clear, actionable diagnostic.
This is an improvement over both BA2 and early BA3:

| Scenario | BA2 | BA3 (initial) | BA3 (current) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unknown code → Rev.AI | `pycountry` crash (uncaught `AttributeError`) | Silent wrong code via `&other[..2]` truncation | Hard error at job submission with alternatives |
| Unknown code → Whisper | `pycountry` crash | Silent English fallback (`return "english"`) | Hard `ValueError` with message |
| Unsupported Rev.AI language | HTTP 400 deep in pipeline | HTTP 400 deep in pipeline | Rejected at submission: "use `--asr-engine whisper`" |

BA2's behavior was accidentally strict — it crashed because nobody added a
None check, not because someone designed early validation. BA3's initial
migration introduced two regressions by trying to be "helpful":

1. **Rev.AI truncation fallback** — `&other[..2]` silently produced wrong
   codes (e.g., `hak` → `ha`, `pol` → `po`). Fixed 2026-03-19 with a ~75
   entry explicit mapping table + `"auto"` fallback with tracing warning.

2. **Whisper English fallback** — `return "english"` when `pycountry` found
   no match. This meant unknown languages were silently transcribed in
   English — the worst possible outcome, since the user gets output that
   looks plausible but is completely wrong. Fixed 2026-03-19 with
   `raise ValueError(...)`.

**Design principle:** A clear error message is always better than silently
wrong results. Users can recover from "language not supported — try
`--asr-engine whisper`" but cannot recover from a transcript that looks
English but should have been Welsh.

### Language-aware UTR strategy selection

The UTR (Utterance Timing Recovery) overlap strategy is now language-aware.
When `--utr-strategy auto` (the default), non-English files use GlobalUtr
and English files use the overlap-inspecting auto-selection. This was
validated experimentally on 7 non-English files across 4 languages:
English gains are preserved (+4.3pp SBCSAE, +3.8pp Jefferson), non-English
regressions are eliminated. See
[Command Flowcharts](../architecture/command-flowcharts.md) for the
decision diagram.

### Per-utterance language routing: improvement over BA2

**Status:** Implemented in BA3. An improvement over both BA2 and
batchalign-next's eager-loading approach.

BA3 implements full per-utterance language routing for morphosyntax:
utterances with `[- fra]` precodes are routed to the French Stanza
pipeline, `[- spa]` to Spanish, etc. The full chain:

1. **Rust** (`morphosyntax/batch.rs`): extracts per-utterance `language_code`
   from `[- lang]` precodes (falls back to `@Languages` header, then to
   primary `--lang`), groups all cache-miss items by language
2. **Rust** (`morphosyntax/batch.rs`): dispatches all language groups
   **concurrently** via `futures::future::join_all` — each language group
   goes to a separate worker process
3. **Rust** (`morphosyntax/worker.rs`): within each language group, splits
   large batches into chunks across up to `max_workers_per_key` (default 4)
   workers of the same language, also via `join_all`
4. **Python worker**: receives one chunk, runs Stanza on it, returns raw UD
   annotations — Python has zero language-routing logic

Language grouping and dispatch are entirely Rust-owned. Python workers are
stateless single-language inference endpoints.

| Behavior | BA2 | BA3 |
|---|---|---|
| `[- lang]` precode parsed | Yes | Yes |
| Per-utterance Stanza routing | **No** (always primary lang) | **Yes** (Rust groups by language) |
| Cross-language parallelism | No | **Yes** (concurrent language groups) |
| Intra-language parallelism | No | **Yes** (chunked across multiple workers) |
| `@s:lang` per-word routing | No | No |

BA2 parsed the `[- lang]` precode into `override_lang` but **never used it
for routing** — it always called `nlp(line_cut)` with the single primary
pipeline, and `parse_sentence(..., lang[0])` always used the first
declared language. When `skipmultilang=True`, BA2 skipped non-primary
utterances entirely; when `False` (default), it processed them with the
wrong language model.

BA3's two-level parallelism means a multilingual batch with N languages
and K workers per language can use N×K workers simultaneously. On fleet
machines (256 GB RAM, 28 cores), a 5-language batch with
`max_workers_per_key=4` uses up to 20 concurrent Stanza workers.

### Unsupported languages

Not all ISO 639-3 codes have Stanza models. The TalkBank corpus includes
files with secondary languages like Quechua (`que`), Jamaican Creole
(`jam`), Min Nan Chinese (`nan`), Tamasheq (`taq`), and `und`
(undetermined). BA2 and BA3 handle these differently:

| Behavior | BA2 | BA3 |
|---|---|---|
| Unsupported secondary language | **Silently processed with wrong model** (MultilingualPipeline falls back to primary language) | **Detected at preflight, skipped with warning** — utterances get empty `%mor`/`%gra` |
| Worker crash on unsupported code | Never (MultilingualPipeline absorbs it) | Never (Rust filters before dispatch) |
| POS accuracy for unsupported langs | **Wrong** (primary-language model applied to foreign text) | **Honest** (empty rather than wrong) |

BA2's `stanza.MultilingualPipeline` was convenient but dishonest: it
silently applied the wrong language model to unsupported languages,
producing POS tags and dependency parses that looked plausible but were
linguistically invalid. BA3's approach is to fail honestly — an empty
`%mor` tier is better than a wrong one, because it signals to the user
that the language needs attention rather than hiding the problem behind
plausible-looking garbage.

The supported language set is maintained in
`batchalign-chat-ops/src/morphosyntax/stanza_languages.rs` (Rust-side
preflight) and `batchalign/worker/_stanza_loading.py` (Python-side
mapping). Both must stay in sync.

### Processor capability discovery

BA2 and early BA3 both hardcoded assumptions about which Stanza
processors are available per language. This caused runtime crashes
when a language lacked an assumed processor.

| Behavior | BA2 | BA3 (before registry) | BA3 (with registry) |
|----------|-----|----------------------|---------------------|
| Capability source | Hardcoded in code | Hardcoded in 7 tables | Stanza `resources.json` (authoritative) |
| Dutch utseg | **Crash** ("constituency not known for nl") | **Crash** (same bug) | Graceful (constituency omitted, sentence-boundary fallback) |
| MWT detection | BA2 exclusion-list inversion | Copy of BA2 exclusion list (`MWT_LANGS`) | Per-language from `resources.json` |
| Unsupported language | Wrong model (MultilingualPipeline fallback) | Reject/skip at dispatch | Reject at submission with clear error |
| iso3→alpha2 mapping | Hardcoded dict (56 codes) | Hardcoded dict (3 copies: Python + 2 Rust) | Derived from `pycountry` + `resources.json` |
| Constituency availability | Always requested (crashed for 180+ languages) | Always requested (same) | Per-language check (~11 languages have it) |

The capability table (`batchalign/worker/_stanza_capabilities.py`) reads
Stanza's `resources.json` once at worker startup and reports per-language
processor availability.  This eliminates the manual sync burden between
Python and Rust and prevents runtime crashes from missing processors.

See [Language Architecture](../architecture/language-architecture.md) for
the remaining gaps (per-word `@s:` routing, per-utterance ASR engine
selection).

### Transcribe: language auto-detection and code-switching (new in BA3)

**Status:** Implemented in BA3. Not available in BA2.

BA3 adds full `--lang auto` support for `transcribe` with two-stage language
detection and automatic code-switching precode generation. This is entirely
new functionality — BA2 had no equivalent.

| Capability | BA2 Jan 9 | BA3 |
|---|---|---|
| `--lang auto` CLI flag | Not explicitly supported; Whisper auto-detect worked implicitly by omitting the `language` kwarg | Fully supported with Rev.AI Language ID pre-pass |
| Primary language detection | None — always used user-specified language | Rev.AI Language ID API (audio-based, ~5-30s, high accuracy); whatlang trigram fallback for Whisper |
| `[- lang]` code-switching precodes | **Never generated during transcribe** | Generated per-utterance via whatlang trigram detection |
| Multi-language `@Languages` header | Single language only | Multiple languages, frequency-ordered, primary first |
| Rev.AI Language Identification API | Not used | Used as pre-pass to detect dominant language from audio features before transcription |

#### How it works

When `--lang auto` is passed with the Rev.AI ASR backend (production path):

1. **Rev.AI Language ID API** (~5-30s): submits audio to a dedicated
   language identification endpoint. Returns `top_language` (e.g., `"es"`)
   with confidence score (e.g., 0.907). This uses audio/phonetic features,
   not text analysis, so it correctly identifies Spanish even in heavily
   code-switched English/Spanish audio.

2. **Transcription with concrete language**: the detected language is used
   as the language hint for the transcription job, which enables
   `speakers_count` and `skip_postprocessing` to be set correctly.

3. **Per-utterance language detection**: after ASR post-processing, each
   utterance is analyzed by `whatlang` (Rust trigram-based detector,
   ~1ms per utterance). Utterances confidently detected as a different
   language than the primary get `[- lang]` precodes in the CHAT output.

4. **Multi-language `@Languages` header**: all languages appearing in >= 3
   utterances are listed in the header, ordered by frequency.

#### Accuracy on bilingual audio

Tested on Miami-Bangor corpus herring03.cha (Spanish-primary, heavy
English code-switching, 30 minutes, 900 utterances in ground truth):

| Metric | Ground Truth | Rev.AI + Language ID | Whisper + whatlang |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@Languages` | `spa, eng` | `spa, eng` (correct) | `eng, spa` (inverted) |
| Primary language | spa | spa (correct) | eng (wrong) |
| `[- eng]` precodes | 415 | 9 | 0 |

The low precode count (9 vs 415) is a known limitation of trigram-based
per-utterance detection — short and code-mixed utterances are below
detection thresholds. See
[Language Architecture: Limitations](../architecture/language-architecture.md#accuracy-and-limitations-of---lang-auto)
for the full accuracy analysis.

#### Why Whisper gets the primary language wrong

Whisper auto-detects language internally per 30-second chunk, but the
HuggingFace pipeline does not expose which language was detected. The
pipeline returns text with `lang="auto"` echoed back, forcing fallback
to whatlang trigram detection on the ASR text output. On code-switched
bilingual text, whatlang frequently misclassifies the primary language
because Spanish utterances containing English words generate enough
English trigrams to tip the majority vote.

Rev.AI's Language ID API avoids this by using audio-level phonetic
features rather than text trigrams.

### Transcribe: ASR post-processing improvements

BA3 ports all 8 BA2 ASR post-processing stages to Rust with provenance
newtypes that prevent mixing text at different pipeline stages:

| Stage | BA2 Jan 9 | BA3 |
|---|---|---|
| Compound merging | Python, ad-hoc string concat | Rust, 3,584 pairs, O(1) HashSet |
| Multi-word splitting | Python, timestamp interpolation | Rust, same algorithm |
| Number expansion | Python, 12 language tables | Rust, same tables |
| Cantonese normalization | Python (OpenCC dependency) | Rust (`zhconv` crate, no OpenCC needed) |
| Long-turn splitting | Python, 300-word threshold | Rust, same threshold |
| Retokenization | Python, punctuation-based | Rust, same algorithm |
| Disfluency replacement | Python, string matching | Rust, same wordlists |
| N-gram retrace detection | Python, ad-hoc grouping | Rust, `WordKind::Retrace` enum + CHAT AST annotation |

**Key correctness improvement:** BA3's retrace detection marks words with
`WordKind::Retrace` in the token pipeline, then `build_chat.rs` wraps them
in proper CHAT `<...> [/]` AST nodes (`AnnotatedWord` / `AnnotatedGroup`).

### Text Cleaning Divergences from BA2

| Operation | BA2 | BA3 | Rationale |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Hyphen normalization | Normalized hyphens before Stanza: stripped trailing dashes, collapsed double dashes to single, replaced `-` with en-dash `–` | **Preserves hyphens** | Stanza handles hyphenated words correctly. Stripping and normalization lose compound info. |
| Parenthesis stripping | Stripped `(` and `)` before Stanza | **No stripping** — Rust `cleaned_text()` handles CHAT notation at extraction time | Python-side stripping silently drops bare paren words, causing word count mismatches. |
| Cantonese word segmentation | None | PyCantonese `segment()` via `--retokenize` | BA2 had no word segmentation for CJK per-character ASR output. |
| Cantonese POS | Stanza zh (Mandarin model, ~62% accuracy) | PyCantonese POS override (~95% on core vocabulary) | BA2 used the same Mandarin model; batchalignHK used zh-hant (equally wrong). |

These divergences mean BA3 morphotag output for Cantonese will differ from
BA2 output. The differences are improvements — BA2's text stripping was lossy
and its POS model was wrong for Cantonese.
BA2 did string-level wrapping that could produce malformed CHAT when
retraces crossed word boundaries or contained special characters.

**Provenance newtypes:** The token pipeline uses distinct types at each
stage (`AsrRawText` → `AsrNormalizedText` → `ChatWordText`) that prevent
accidentally passing text from one stage to another without the required
transformation. BA2 used bare `str` throughout.

### Transcribe: Rev.AI language code mapping

BA2 used `pycountry.languages.get(alpha_3=lang).alpha_2` for ISO 639-3
to Rev.AI code conversion. When `pycountry` returned `None` for an unknown
language code, BA2 crashed with an uncaught `AttributeError` (no fallback
at all). Early BA3 Rust code introduced a silent truncation fallback
(`&other[..2]`) that produced wrong codes for many languages:
- `pol` → `po` (should be `pl`)
- `hak` → `ha` (not a valid ISO 639-1 code)
- `ces` → `ce` (should be `cs`)

BA3 replaces this with an explicit 85+ entry mapping table in
`revai/preflight.rs`, with an `"auto"` fallback for unmapped languages
(logged as a warning). The reverse mapping (`revai_code_to_iso639_3`)
returns `Option` rather than panicking on unknown codes.
