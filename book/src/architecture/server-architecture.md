# Server Dispatch Architecture

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-21 15:30

This page describes the implemented `batchalign3` runtime:

- `batchalign-cli` handles CLI parsing, file discovery, dispatch, daemon
  lifecycle, and local output writing.
- `batchalign-app` provides the HTTP server, job store, worker pool, OpenAPI,
  and server-side CHAT orchestration.
- Python workers in `batchalign/worker/` load ML dependencies and execute
  inference over stdio JSON-lines IPC.

The Rust control plane never loads ML models directly.

## Design rationale

The current split exists to keep the control plane separate from the ML runtime:

1. The CLI and server share one Rust workspace and one typed contract surface.
2. Remote-only clients can use the CLI without local ML dependencies.
3. Local processing still relies on Python workers, but model loading is pushed
   out of the Rust process and managed through the worker pool.
4. Rust owns CHAT parsing, validation, cache lookup, injection, and
   serialization for the server-side command paths.

## Locked de-Pythonization boundary

The current repository finish line is **not** "remove Python completely." The
boundary is intentionally narrower and should be treated as the target for
future cleanup work:

- keep the worker subprocess model;
- keep Python only at direct model/SDK boundaries plus the thinnest bootstrap
  and dispatch code needed to host those calls;
- move everything practical that is provider-independent — config ownership,
  payload preparation, cache policy, post-processing, validation, CHAT
  mutation, and orchestration — into Rust;
- keep already-landed BA2 compatibility shims out of scope for this wave.

| Bucket | Current surfaces | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| Must stay Python | `batchalign/worker/`, `batchalign/inference/`, `batchalign/models/` | steady-state model host |
| Split / keep thin | `batchalign/pipeline_api.py`, `batchalign/providers/`, schema mirrors at the worker boundary | keep a small adapter layer only; Rust owns document semantics |
| Move to Rust | production config/runtime policy, provider-independent pre/post-processing, generic compatibility request bags, WER convenience glue | continue shrinking Python here |
| Out of scope | `batchalign.compat` and other BA2 migration shims | preserve as migration surface; do not treat as target architecture |

The detailed module inventory lives in
[Python/Rust Interface](python-rust-interface.md#locked-de-pythonization-target).

```

## Runtime ownership boundaries

The server runtime is organized around three owned subsystems plus one shallow
route-state aggregate:

- `JobStore` owns in-memory job state plus SQLite write-through
- `RuntimeSupervisor` owns the queue-dispatch loop and tracked per-job tasks
- `WorkerPool` owns Python worker process lifecycle and serializes per-key
  bootstrap so bursty demand does not launch multiple heavy workers for the
  same bucket at once
- `AppState` groups route-visible handles as control plane, worker subsystem,
  environment, and build identity

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    routes["Routes"] --> store["JobStore"]
    routes --> supervisor["RuntimeSupervisor"]
    supervisor --> queue["Queue dispatcher"]
    supervisor --> jobs["Job tasks"]
    jobs --> pool["WorkerPool"]
    store --> db["SQLite"]
    routes --> state["AppState"]
    state --> control["Control plane"]
    state --> workers["Worker subsystem"]
    state --> environment["Environment"]
    state --> build["Build identity"]
```

## Shared-state ownership rule

The control-plane rule is:

- state that coordinates multiple routes, jobs, or background tasks gets an
  owned task or actor boundary
- mutexes stay private to a subsystem when they only protect tiny local cells

`JobRegistry` actorization completed that rule for the main in-memory jobs map.
Routes, query modules, and runner code now call named `JobStore`/`JobRegistry`
methods instead of borrowing a shared lock.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    callers["Routes / queries / runner"] --> store["Named store methods"]
    store --> registry["JobRegistry actor"]
    registry --> map["Owned jobs map"]
    registry -. "recovery only" .-> bulk["inspect_all / mutate_all"]
```

`inspect_all()` / `mutate_all()` remain deliberate escape hatches for crash
recovery and other rare collection-wide reconciliation. New feature work should
prefer per-job projections and transitions. Local mutexes still exist inside
subsystems such as `OperationalCounterStore` and `WorkerPool`, but those are
owner-private implementation details rather than architectural coordination
seams.

## Route state boundary

HTTP handlers share one `Arc<AppState>`, but the root state is intentionally
shallow:

- `AppControlPlane` for job store, queue wakeups, runtime supervision, and WS
  broadcast
- `WorkerSubsystem` for worker-pool access and command capability data
- `AppEnvironment` for config, media resolution, and filesystem roots
- `AppBuildInfo` for version/build identity reported to clients

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    routes["HTTP handlers"] --> state["AppState"]
    state --> control["AppControlPlane"]
    state --> workers["WorkerSubsystem"]
    state --> environment["AppEnvironment"]
    state --> build["AppBuildInfo"]
```

That keeps route code from depending on a flat catch-all server struct and
keeps runner-only dependencies such as cache and infer metadata out of shared
handler state entirely.

## Job shape

`JobStore` still owns a shared jobs registry, but it now does so through an
explicit `JobRegistry` component with named operations for submission,
listing, cancellation, queue claiming, and runner snapshots, plus narrower
per-job helpers for the remaining local transitions. `OperationalCounters`
also live in their own `OperationalCounterStore` component instead of another
interior `Arc<Mutex<_>>`. The registry's shared map now lives inside one owned
actor task: `JobStore` and the surrounding query/runner helpers send `Inspect`
or `Mutate` commands over an unbounded channel and await `oneshot` replies, so
access is serialized at a message boundary rather than through a shared mutex
field. Each `Job` is also no longer a flat field bag. The current runtime shape
is grouped as:

- `JobIdentity`
- `JobDispatchConfig`
- `JobSourceContext`
- `JobFilesystemConfig`
- `JobExecutionState`
- `JobScheduleState`
- `JobRuntimeControl`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    job["Job"] --> identity["Identity"]
    job --> dispatch["Dispatch"]
    job --> source["Source context"]
    job --> filesystem["Filesystem"]
    job --> execution["Execution state"]
    job --> schedule["Schedule and lease"]
    job --> runtime["Runtime control"]
```

That split matters because routes, queueing, and runner code no longer need one
30+ field interior runtime record just to touch one concern.

## Runner boundary

The runner now has a sharper read/write split:

- dispatchers receive immutable `RunnerJobSnapshot` values for static job
  configuration
- `JobStore` owns named execution mutations, and `JobRegistry` owns the
  in-memory projection/transition API, but the actual job-level state
  transitions for re-queue, running, failure, and finalization now live on
  `Job`
- registry methods now return typed summary/file projections for WebSocket
  publication, so query modules no longer borrow raw `Job` values just to
  publish live updates
- queue dispatch now uses typed `QueuePoll` snapshots and
  `LeaseRenewalOutcome` instead of raw strings, timestamps, and booleans
- file-level status transitions now reconcile through `Job` methods and then
  flow through runner utility helpers, instead of open-coded store-lock blocks
  in every dispatcher

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    runner["run_job"] --> snapshot["RunnerJobSnapshot"]
    runner --> mutations["JobStore execution methods"]
    mutations --> jobexec["Job execution transitions"]
    snapshot --> dispatch["FA / transcribe / infer dispatchers"]
    dispatch --> fileops["File status helpers"]
    fileops --> job["Job file transitions"]
    jobexec --> store["JobStore"]
    job --> store
```

That still leaves a shared logical job registry, but callers now cross the
registry actor boundary instead of reaching for a shared lock or open-coded
store-wide collection helpers. The remaining bulk escape hatches stay inside
`JobRegistry` for recovery-style operations that genuinely need collection-wide
ownership.

## Queue and lease boundary

The local queue backend now crosses the store boundary with typed values:

- `QueuePoll` for claimed ready jobs plus the next wake deadline
- `LeaseRenewalOutcome` for the heartbeat loop
- `Job` methods for local-dispatch readiness, claim, release, and renewal

That keeps queue wakeups and lease renewal from depending on `Vec<String>`,
`Option<f64>`, bare booleans, and open-coded lease field mutation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    store["JobStore"] --> job["Job lease methods"]
    job --> poll["QueuePoll"]
    poll --> backend["QueueBackend"]
    backend --> dispatcher["QueueDispatcher"]
    runner["Job task"] --> lease["LeaseRenewalOutcome"]
    lease --> job
```

## Current crate and package map

| Component | Current location | Role |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| CLI | `crates/batchalign-cli` | clap CLI, dispatch router, daemon lifecycle, output writing |
| Server | `crates/batchalign-app` | axum routes, job store, worker pool, OpenAPI, server-side orchestration |
| CHAT ops | `crates/batchalign-chat-ops` | CHAT extraction, injection, validation, FA/morphosyntax helpers |
| Python worker | `batchalign/worker/` | worker entry point, model loading, capabilities, infer/execute dispatch |
| Python inference | `batchalign/inference/` | engine-specific inference backends |

Older names such as the nested Rust workspace and `batchalign-server` are
historical. `batchalign-types` is an active crate that holds shared domain
newtypes and worker protocol types (see the workspace `Cargo.toml`).

## Dispatch resolution

The CLI router in `crates/batchalign-cli/src/dispatch/mod.rs` resolves targets
in this order:

1. explicit `--server`
2. local daemon if `auto_daemon` is enabled
3. error

Special cases:

- `transcribe`, `transcribe_s`, `benchmark`, and `avqi` force local-daemon
  dispatch because they need local media access
- multi-server `--server URL1,URL2` is rejected in the current release
- a sidecar daemon can be used when the main daemon lacks transcribe-related
  capabilities

## Server endpoints in use

The current server exposes these job/control endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /jobs`
- `GET /jobs`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/results`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/results/{filename}`
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel`
- `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}`
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/restart`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/stream`
- `GET /media/list`
- `GET /ws`

Dashboard and bug-report routes are also present, but the list above is the
core processing surface.

## Concurrency mapping

| Legacy Python implementation | Rust rewrite equivalent |
|---|---|
| `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-heavy commands | Stanza/IO profile: persistent Python subprocesses, exclusive checkout |
| `ThreadPoolExecutor` for GPU/ASR paths | GPU profile: `SharedGpuWorker` with Python `ThreadPoolExecutor` inside one process |
| Global pool size logic in Python server | Job-level semaphore (`max_concurrent_jobs`) + per-profile pool limits in Rust server |

Additional safeguards:
- Memory gate before job start (skipped when idle workers for the job's `(command, lang)` already exist in the pool).
- Auto-concurrency defaults use 12 GB/slot and hard-cap at 8 slots.

## Command routing

| Command class | Routing behavior |
|---|---|
| `morphotag`, `align`, `translate`, `utseg`, `coref`, `compare` | Explicit single `--server` or local daemon |
| `transcribe`, `transcribe_s`, `benchmark`, `avqi` | Always routed to local daemon (explicit remote `--server` is ignored) |

For sidecar-eligible local-daemon commands, CLI tries:
1. Main local daemon
2. Sidecar daemon (if main lacks capability)

Current sidecar-eligible commands: `transcribe`, `transcribe_s`, `benchmark`, `avqi`.

## Server-side inference

For text-only commands, the server owns the full CHAT lifecycle — no CHAT text crosses IPC to Python workers:

1. **Parse** — read `.cha` files, parse into ChatFile AST
2. **Extract** — collect payloads (words, text) from the AST
3. **Cache check** — look up each utterance in the server-side UtteranceCache
4. **Infer** — send cache misses to Python workers via typed `execute_v2`
   requests (cross-file batching per language for text tasks)
5. **Inject** — insert model results back into the AST
6. **Serialize** — validate and write output `.cha` files

| Command | Dispatch Path | Worker Role |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| morphotag, utseg, translate, coref | infer (cross-file) | Stateless model inference only |
| align | infer (per-file, per-group) | Stateless audio/text alignment inference |
| transcribe, transcribe_s | infer (per-file audio) | Raw ASR inference feeding a Rust-owned pipeline |
| benchmark | infer (per-file audio + compare) | Raw ASR inference feeding Rust transcribe + compare |
| opensmile, avqi | infer (per-file media V2) | Rust-owned prepared-audio media analysis over typed worker requests |

There is no standalone CLI `speaker` command in batchalign3, matching
batchalign2. Speaker diarization remains a worker capability used to support
`transcribe_s` and typed V2 execution.

## SSE job streaming

For lightweight real-time progress monitoring (alternative to WebSocket):

```
GET /jobs/{job_id}/stream
```

Returns Server-Sent Events:
- `snapshot` — initial file statuses on connect
- `file_update` — per-file status changes
- `job_update` — overall job status changes
- `complete` — job finished (stream closes)

## Worker protocol

Workers are spawned by the server pool and communicate over stdio JSON-lines.
The key operations are:

- `health`
- `capabilities` — reports infer tasks and engine versions; Rust derives commands
- `process`
- `batch_infer` (shrinking compatibility path)
- `execute_v2` (live typed infer path)
- `shutdown`

The current Rust worker handle tolerates a bounded amount of non-protocol
stdout noise while waiting for startup or a response, which protects the pool
from common library banners and download messages. Protocol-shaped malformed
JSON is still treated as a hard framing error so the request fails loudly
instead of silently desynchronizing the stream.

For live `execute_v2` requests, the worker/result contract is also split on
purpose: malformed request payloads and unreadable prepared artifacts stay in
`invalid_payload` / attachment error buckets, while malformed model-host output
is reported as `runtime_failure`. That keeps bad Python/SDK result shapes from
masquerading as caller input mistakes.

### Concurrent dispatch for GPU workers

GPU profile workers support concurrent V2 requests via request_id multiplexing:

- Rust sends multiple `execute_v2` requests to one GPU worker without waiting for responses
- Python's `_serve_stdio_concurrent()` dispatches to a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (4 threads)
- Responses carry `request_id` fields — Rust's background reader routes them to pending oneshot channels
- Non-V2 ops (health, capabilities, shutdown) use a separate sequential control channel

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R1 as Rust task 1
    participant R2 as Rust task 2
    participant W as GPU Worker
    participant T1 as Python thread 1
    participant T2 as Python thread 2

    R1->>W: execute_v2(id=1, FA)
    R2->>W: execute_v2(id=2, FA)
    W->>T1: dispatch(id=1)
    W->>T2: dispatch(id=2)
    T2-->>W: response(id=2)
    W-->>R2: response(id=2)
    T1-->>W: response(id=1)
    W-->>R1: response(id=1)
```

`execute_v2` is the main path for live server-owned inference:

- Rust prepares text/audio artifacts
- Python workers run inference on those prepared inputs
- Rust injects results back into the AST and serializes output

`batch_infer` remains only as a shrinking compatibility surface:

- Rust extracts payloads from CHAT
- Python workers run inference on those payloads
- Rust injects results back into the AST and serializes output

This path is intentionally **not** the target boundary for new work. New
control-plane logic should land either in Rust or on the typed `execute_v2`
surface, not by widening `process` or `batch_infer`.

Rev.AI preflight submission is no longer a worker IPC operation. The Rust
server now performs that upload burst directly through the shared
`batchalign-revai` crate so the Python boundary stays inference-only. The same
server-owned boundary now also handles Rev.AI-backed raw ASR inference for
`transcribe` and `benchmark`, plus Rev-backed timed-word recovery for `align`
UTR.

### Capability detection

At startup, the server spawns a **probe worker** to discover which infer tasks
the Python environment supports. The probe uses `importlib` to check whether
each task's dependencies are installed and returns a non-empty engine version
for every advertised task — it does not load full models. Rust then derives the
released command surface from that infer-task set and gates job submission on
the derived commands only.

See [Capability Detection](engine-interface.md#capability-detection) for the
full flow, the import probe table, and troubleshooting tips.

## Local daemon state

The local daemon uses the same configured port from `~/.batchalign3/server.yaml`
(default `8000`). It records state in `daemon.json` and can start a separate
sidecar profile for transcribe workloads.

`serve start` writes `server.pid` and `server.log` for manually started servers.
Auto-daemon state is tracked separately from manual `serve start`.

## Startup recovery

Server startup now treats crash recovery as an explicit typed transition rather
than ad hoc map mutation.

1. SQLite marks previously active jobs as `Interrupted`.
2. `JobStore::load_from_db()` rebuilds each `Job` value from persisted rows.
3. `Job::reconcile_recovered_runtime_state()` decides the canonical next state:
   requeue unfinished work or promote all-terminal jobs to `Completed` /
   `Failed`.
4. The reconciled status and cleared lease metadata are written back to SQLite
   before normal queue dispatch resumes.

That keeps the in-memory control plane and the persisted recovery snapshot in
sync after every restart.
