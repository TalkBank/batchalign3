# One-Click Installers

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-17

Scripts for installing Batchalign3 without requiring users to open a terminal
or type commands manually.

## macOS

**File:** `macos/install-batchalign3.command`

1. Download the file.
2. Double-click it in Finder.
3. If macOS Gatekeeper blocks it:
   - Right-click the file > **Open** > **Open** in the dialog.
   - Or: System Settings > Privacy & Security > scroll down > **Open Anyway**.
4. A Terminal window will open showing installation progress.
5. When done, open a **new** Terminal window and run `batchalign3 --help`.

The script installs `uv` (if not present) and then installs `batchalign3`
via `uv tool install`. Re-running the script upgrades an existing installation.

## Windows

**File:** `windows/install-batchalign3.bat`

1. Download the file.
2. Double-click it in Explorer.
3. If Windows SmartScreen blocks it: click **More info** > **Run anyway**.
4. A Command Prompt window will open showing installation progress.
5. When done, open a **new** PowerShell or Command Prompt and run
   `batchalign3 --help`.

The script installs `uv` (if not present) via PowerShell and then installs
`batchalign3` via `uv tool install`. Re-running the script upgrades an
existing installation.

## Distribution tier assessment

| Tier | What | Status | Effort |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 (current) | `.command` / `.bat` scripts | **Live** | Done |
| 1.5 | GitHub Releases with platform wheels | **Staged** (`release.yml` ready; publishing on hold) | Done |
| 2 | `.pkg` (macOS) + `.exe` (Windows) bundled installers | Not started | 4-6 days |
| 3 | Tauri desktop GUI with built-in updater | Dormant | 1-2 weeks |

**Tier 1** covers the immediate need: users who can't find Terminal/PowerShell
or follow `curl` instructions can download a file and double-click it.

**Tier 1.5** is wired in `release.yml` and tested locally via
`test-github-release.sh`, but it remains a staged release-preparation path for
now. Keep the wheel-building and download/install flow working, but do **not**
treat this as authorization to publish new GitHub Releases or resume PyPI.
Public release work stays on hold until the signing/notarization expectations in
`../../docs/code-signing-and-distribution.md` are wired for any direct macOS app
or CLI downloads and the broader release gate reopens.

**Tier 2** would provide native OS installers (macOS `.pkg` signed with Apple
Developer ID, Windows `.exe` via Inno Setup or WiX) that appear in
Applications/Programs and include uninstallers. This requires code signing
certificates and platform-specific build infrastructure.

**Tier 3** would wrap the CLI in a native desktop application with a graphical
interface. Infrastructure exists at `apps/dashboard-desktop/` (Tauri v2.8 +
React) with a CI workflow at `.github/workflows/dashboard-desktop.yml`, but
the surface is dormant and not functional for end users.

### Tauri desktop app: current status and prereqs

The [Tauri + React Dashboard ADR](../book/src/decisions/tauri-react-dashboard-adoption.md)
accepted Tauri as the long-term desktop path (2026-02-25). The ADR commits to
shipping a minimum viable desktop app before public release. What's needed:

1. **File/folder picker** — Tauri native dialog feeding paths to the
   batchalign3 server
2. **Progress display** — SSE from server rendered in the React UI
3. **Auto-start server** — launch `batchalign3 serve start` on app open
4. **Auto-update** — Tauri's built-in updater (requires signing keys)
5. **Signed bundles** — notarized `.app` for macOS, signed `.exe` for Windows

PyPI release preparation follows the same staged-but-on-hold rule. Wheel builds
and installer tests should stay green, but this README documents readiness, not
permission to publish.

## Testing

Both scripts support `BATCHALIGN_PACKAGE` (override package spec) and `CI=true`
(skip interactive prompts) environment variables for automated testing.

```bash
# Test the macOS installer (builds wheel, isolated sandbox, cleanup)
bash installers/test.sh

# Reuse an existing wheel in dist/
bash installers/test.sh --no-build

# Test the full GitHub Release flow (creates draft release, downloads, installs)
bash installers/test-github-release.sh
bash installers/test-github-release.sh --no-build
```

Both test scripts use `UV_TOOL_DIR`/`UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` to install into an
isolated temp directory — they do not affect the developer's real tool
installations. The GitHub Release test creates a draft pre-release, verifies
the download + install path, then deletes the draft on cleanup.
